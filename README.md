Converter
=========
It is a converter which converts one file format to another. I have took an example of some .gd and .gne file formats. It can be compiled by using the script a.sh

Install dependencies :-

<code>
sudo apt-get install flex, sudo apt-get install bison 
</code>

Commands to compile this code are :-

<code>
bash a.sh, ./conv
</code>
